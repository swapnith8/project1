Task 1 - Postgresql:
Created an account in Heroku and created a new app named ”project-2019501087”
Selected "Hobby Dev" plan for free access of PostgreSQL database.
In settings there are my credentials and there was a URL through which I accessed my database locally in my system.

Time elapsed for this task : 15-20mins


Task 2 - Python and Flask:
Since I already have python and pip. I directly downloaded project1 from the given link which contained application.py, books.csv, readme.md and requirements.txt files. .   
Through running the command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" in the command prompt the requirements given in that text files are read.
Then I tried to run flask using command "flask run" then I got a http request link which tried to open in chrome but got an error.
So, I used these commands 
 1. pip3 uninstall werkzeug
 2. pip3 install werkzeug==0.16.0
i.e., I have uninstalled the werkzeug old version and installed the required one.
After this again I tried opening the http link in chrome this time I got it correct
I.e; it displayed "Project 1: TODO"!

Time elapsed for this task : 50-60mins
